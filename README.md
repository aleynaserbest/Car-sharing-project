# Car-Sharing-Project
Come-491 Research Project course, Design and Back-end development repository
# INTRODUCTION
## Purpose of the system
The purpose of this project is to gather the drivers and passengers of the university students on a platform and enable them to communicate.
## Objectives
-	To provide infrastructure for students to find comfortable and safe vehicles on the way to school.
-	To provide infrastructure so that drivers can find passengers who can contribute to their fuel money.
-	Enabling students to communicate securely using student e-mails.
## Planning
In this project, we aimed to design a system where drivers and users can find each other. This system is a Web-based application.
First, decisions will be made about Requirement analysis and how the processes should work. This process is expected to take 3 weeks. 
After these processes, use cases and flowcharts of the processes will be created. Then we will move on to processes such as Er-uml. 
It is added that these processes take 3 weeks. For backend developments, Java, Springboot,
We decided to use PostgreSql for database and Heroku for deployment. This backend development process is expected to take 7 weeks. 
Technologies such as JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap will be used for Frontend. This process should take 6 weeks. After these processes,
bug-fixes are planned. These bug-fixes should take 2 weeks. After all these processes are completed, the first version of the project should have been created.

# Testing

First, we import the `car-sharing-project.postman_collection.json` file into postman. You add the collection file of our project to your own postman application.

You are doing the login process.

We copy the token from here and add it to the global variable in the postman.

After doing this, you should have a screen like this. Environment quick look -> Globals -> variable

Now you can run and view other requests and responses.
