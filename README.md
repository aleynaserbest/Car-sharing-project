# Car-Sharing-Project
Come-491 Research Project course, Design and Back-end development repository
# INTRODUCTION
## Purpose of the system
The purpose of this project is to gather the drivers and passengers of the university students on a platform and enable them to communicate.
## Objectives
-	To provide infrastructure for students to find comfortable and safe vehicles on the way to school.
-	To provide infrastructure so that drivers can find passengers who can contribute to their fuel money.
-	Enabling students to communicate securely using student e-mails.
## Planning
In this project, we aimed to design a system where drivers and users can find each other. This system is a Web-based application.
First, decisions will be made about Requirement analysis and how the processes should work. This process is expected to take 3 weeks. 
After these processes, use cases and flowcharts of the processes will be created. Then we will move on to processes such as Er-uml. 
It is added that these processes take 3 weeks. For backend developments, Java, Springboot,
We decided to use PostgreSql for database and Heroku for deployment. This backend development process is expected to take 7 weeks. 
Technologies such as JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap will be used for Frontend. This process should take 6 weeks. After these processes,
bug-fixes are planned. These bug-fixes should take 2 weeks. After all these processes are completed, the first version of the project should have been created.
